# campo-minado

Welcome, minefield project.

To run the project, I recommend having Eclipse as IDE, visually the game will be on the console ok?

In the Application class, it is where the instance that determines the amount of rows and columns and mines is located.

To play, it has an intuitive coordinate ruler (x) rows (y) column, it has the instruction 1 to open, 2 to mark, but if a mine appears you lose, but you will have the option to restart.
